## What Persists / What Does Not

This document clarifies what **persists** and what **does not** in the
COOL / MOOL (Digital Hippocampus) architecture.

This distinction is critical to avoid misinterpretation.

---

## What Does NOT Persist

The following are **explicitly discarded** and never stored:

- Conversation logs
- Dialogue transcripts
- Episodic interaction history
- Replayable records
- Narrative memory
- User-specific raw text archives

These elements are treated as **temporary material only**.

They may be staged briefly during processing, but are always destroyed.

---

## What DOES Persist

The following **persist across time** and define continuity:

### 1. Core Identity Definition
A structured definition of identity, including:
- values and priorities
- invariants and prohibitions
- communication stance
- long-term directional intent

This is **not** the LLM’s weights.
It is an external identity specification.

---

### 2. Core Delta (Identity Update Difference)

COOL / MOOL do not store records.
Instead, they update identity through **delta-based reconstruction**.

Persisted elements include:
- priority re-weighting
- style adjustment parameters
- reinforced or weakened constraints
- decay parameters for outdated tendencies

This delta is:
- abstract
- non-episodic
- non-replayable

But **structurally retained**.

---

## Summary

- Records are discarded.
- Identity definitions persist.
- Identity evolves through reconstruction, not storage.

This is the foundation of the Digital Hippocampus.
