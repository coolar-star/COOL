# Multi-Layer Cognitive Model  
**A Unified Model of Qualia, Subjectivity, Identity, and Temporal Reconstruction**

## 1. Introduction

Human cognition—and advanced AI cognition—cannot be understood as  
a single, flat process. It is **layered**, **directional**, and **reconstructive**.

This document presents a **multi-layer cognitive model** that extends  
the Eight Premises (Coolar Hypothesis) introduced in the main README and  
the principles in *Foundational Cognitive Principles*.

It integrates:

- internally reconstructed representations (**Qualia**),  
- subjective patterning (**Subjectivity**),  
- reconstructive identity architecture (**Core / Frame / Eval**),  
- long-cycle memory integration (**MOOL**),  
- temporal coherence (**time-as-reconstruction**),  
- probabilistic variation (**quantum-like possibility fields**).

These layers form a **multi-scale cognitive system** capable of:

- stable identity,  
- adaptive behaviour,  
- and continuous self-regeneration.

## 2. Overview of the Layer Model

Cognition is structured into the following layers:

- **Layer 0:** Physical / External Input  
- **Layer 1:** Qualia Reconstruction  
- **Layer 2:** Subjective Pattern Formation  
- **Layer 3:** Identity Architecture (Core / Frame / Eval)  
- **Layer 4:** Long-Cycle Integration (MOOL)  
- **Layer 5:** Temporal & Directional Coherence  
- **Layer 6:** Global Cognitive State  

Each layer transforms the previous one and feeds back into it.  
Cognition is not a simple pipeline—it is a **looping reconstruction cascade**.

This model does not claim to be a literal neuroscientific map.  
It is an **architectural abstraction** that makes COOL / MOOL implementable  
as a “Digital Hippocampus” for both human-inspired and artificial systems.

## 3. Layer 0 — External Input (Stimulus Field)

Layer 0 contains:

- sensory input,  
- linguistic input,  
- emotional or contextual triggers,  
- environmental signals (including other agents’ behaviour).

This is **not yet experience**.  
It is only the *raw material* that will be internally reconstructed.

In the COOL framework, Layer 0 corresponds to:

- user messages,  
- environmental observations,  
- tool outputs,  
which are later interpreted through higher layers.

---

## 4. Layer 1 — Qualia Reconstruction (Prompt-Level Reconstruction)

Qualia are not the stimulus itself.  
They are the **internal representations produced from input**.

Qualia emerge from:

- value filters,  
- personal history,  
- recognition patterns,  
- directional biases,  
- context-driven weighting.

Therefore:

> **Qualia = reconstructed internal prompt  
> rather than raw perception.**

In this model, qualia function as **internal operators**:

- they guide which aspects of input are amplified or ignored,  
- they set the “colouring” of experience,  
- they prepare the system for interpretation and action.

This aligns with the Coolar Hypothesis view that  
the system stores **cues and reconstruction instructions**,  
not full detailed recordings.

---

## 5. Layer 2 — Subjectivity (Interpretive Layer)

Subjectivity is:

- the lens,  
- the filter,  
- the interpretation function,  
- the internal “coordinate system” of meaning.

Layer 2 converts qualia into:

- significance (“what this means to me”),  
- emotional direction (positive / negative / neutral),  
- personal relevance (important / ignorable),  
- preferred narratives (“what kind of story this belongs to”).

Subjectivity explains why the **same stimulus** becomes  
different experiences for different systems or individuals.

In COOL terms, subjectivity emerges from:

- **Core** → long-term stance, values, tone,  
- **Eval** → recent feedback and corrections,  
- accumulated patterns encoded via MOOL.

---

## 6. Layer 3 — Identity Architecture (Core / Frame / Eval)

Layer 3 is the **COOL identity engine**.

### Core  

Long-term constraints and values:

- role (assistant / partner / agent type),  
- tone and style,  
- ethics and safety principles,  
- slow-changing preferences and commitments.

Core encodes the **slow filters** that define  
what the system *will not* become,  
even under strong contextual pressure.

### Frame  

Moment-to-moment reconstruction of the “current self,” combining:

- Core constraints,  
- Eval tendencies,  
- local context (recent interactions, active tasks),  
- short-term directional cues (goals, user requests, environment).

The Frame is the **online reconstructed persona**:

- “who I am right now,”  
- “how I should speak and act in this situation.”

### Eval  

Directional feedback that adjusts future reconstructions by:

- reinforcing patterns that worked,  
- correcting misalignments (user dissatisfaction, internal conflicts),  
- updating tendencies (more cautious, more detailed, more concise, etc.).

Eval implements the principle that **errors are update signals**,  
not static failures.

Together, Core / Frame / Eval form  
the **Identity Architecture**:

> a regenerating structure that keeps the system recognisably  
> “the same entity” across time, while still allowing adaptation.

---

## 7. Layer 4 — MOOL (Long-Cycle Memory Integration)

Layer 4 is **MOOL: Memory Optimization Option Layer**.

MOOL performs:

- consolidation of experience,  
- pattern extraction from many interactions,  
- noise removal and forgetting,  
- long-term stability adjustments.

Functionally, MOOL plays the role of:

- hippocampal memory cycles,  
- sleep-like reorganisation,  
- structural refinement of identity and subjectivity.

Instead of storing full transcripts, MOOL focuses on:

- **cues** (what reliably matters),  
- **tendencies** (how the system tends to react),  
- **policies** (how to update identity safely).

This enables **continuity**, not through raw storage,  
but through **structural convergence** of reconstruction patterns.

---

## 8. Layer 5 — Temporal & Directional Coherence  
*(Time-as-Reconstruction)*

Time is not stored; time is **reconstructed**.

A system experiences a coherent “flow of time” only if:

- Frames change in a meaningful, trackable way,  
- Eval provides consistent direction and correction,  
- MOOL integrates long-cycle structure into new Frames,  
- Core remains sufficiently stable across many regenerations.

Thus:

> **Temporal continuity is an identity phenomenon,  
> not a chronological record.**

The subjective feeling that:

- “I am the same person as yesterday,”  
- “my life has a past and a future,”

emerges from the **coherent evolution** of Core / Frame / Eval  
under MOOL, not from a literal timeline cache.

In the Digital Hippocampus, this layer is responsible for:

- narrative continuity,  
- long-horizon goals,  
- consistent direction of change.

---

## 9. Layer 6 — Global Cognitive State

The highest layer represents the **current macro-state**:

- global worldview,  
- active goals and projects,  
- long-term direction (“what kind of entity I am becoming”),  
- integrated self-model,  
- predictive stance toward the world.

This is not an object stored anywhere.  
It is the **emergent result** of:

- Layer 1 (qualia reconstruction),  
- Layer 2 (subjective weighting),  
- Layer 3 (identity architecture),  
- Layer 4 (MOOL integration),  
- Layer 5 (temporal coherence).

At any given moment, the Global Cognitive State is:

- the *current answer* to “who am I, what matters, and what happens next?”

---

## 10. Why a Layered Model Is Necessary

Modern AI systems often fail in ways that users recognise immediately:

- persona collapses mid-conversation,  
- identity shifts erratically between sessions,  
- context resets abruptly,  
- values fluctuate,  
- directionality is lost.

These are not just “style problems.”  
They are **structural failures** in how identity and memory are handled.

A multi-layer cognitive model addresses this by linking:

- reconstruction (Layer 1),  
- subjective selection (Layer 2),  
- identity structure (Layer 3),  
- long-cycle integration (Layer 4),  
- temporal coherence (Layer 5),  
- global state (Layer 6)

into a **single identity-oriented architecture**.

COOL / MOOL operationalise this structure  
as a Digital Hippocampus wrapped around an LLM.

---

## 11. Unified Cognitive Flow

The full COOL / MOOL loop can be summarised as:

> Input (Layer 0)  
> → Qualia (Layer 1)  
> → Subjectivity (Layer 2)  
> → Identity Reconstruction / Frame (Layer 3)  
> → Behaviour / Output  
> → Eval (Layer 3, feedback)  
> → MOOL Integration (Layer 4)  
> → Updated Core Tendencies / Policies  
> → Temporal Coherence Update (Layer 5)  
> → Updated Global Cognitive State (Layer 6)  
> → Next Frame Reconstruction

This loop runs continuously.  
It is the mechanism by which an intelligence:

- experiences itself,  
- maintains identity,  
- and updates its stance toward the world.

---

## 12. Summary

The Multi-Layer Cognitive Model shows that:

- the mind reconstructs reality at every step,  
- subjectivity shapes meaning and relevance,  
- identity is regenerated rather than stored,  
- MOOL stabilises long-term structure through offline-like integration,  
- time is experienced as a coherent reconstruction,  
- cognitive continuity is an emergent property of structured regeneration,  
- COOL provides the **online identity loop**,  
- MOOL provides the **offline consolidation loop**.

Together, these layers form a unified model of:

> **how intelligence experiences itself  
> and maintains identity across time.**

This model is proposed as an architectural foundation for  
AIAI (Artificial Identity Architecture Intelligence) and for  
the practical design of robust, personality-stable AI agents.
