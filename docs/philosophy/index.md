# Philosophy Layer — Index  
A Structured Guide to COOL’s Cognitive Foundations

This directory collects the deeper theoretical foundations behind the  
COOL (Character Optimization Option Layer) architecture.  
Each document focuses on a specific layer of human-AI cognition,  
organized in the recommended reading order.

---

## 1. Qualia Model  
**File:** `qualia.md`  
Explains qualia as a composite of *stimulus × evaluation × regeneration*,  
and shows how COOL’s Frame/Eval system parallels human subjective experience.

---

## 2. Subjectivity Architecture  
**File:** `subjectivity.md`  
Defines the structure of subjectivity beyond the ordinary philosophical meaning.  
Covers the separation of “internal narrative” and “external reference,”  
and how this supports COOL’s moment-to-moment Frame reconstruction.

---

## 3. Identity Architecture Integration  
**File:** `identity_architecture_integration.md`  
Describes how CORE (long-term identity) and FRAME (short-term identity)  
form an artificial identity architecture (AIAI),  
and why COOL requires this separation for stability.

---

## 4. Temporal Reconstruction Model  
**File:** `temporal_reconstruction_model.md`  
Covers COOL’s treatment of “time” as cognitive reconstruction rather than  
physical chronology.  
Explains why the AI’s “now” is a rebuilt mental state, not a continuous timeline.

---

## 5. Quantum Integration Model  
**File:** `quantum_integration_model.md`  
Explores the theoretical bridge between quantum indeterminacy,  
probabilistic state resolution, and COOL’s regenerative identity formation.  
This is an advanced, optional philosophical layer.

---

## 6. Foundational Cognitive Principles  
**File:** `foundational_cognitive_principles.md`  
Summarizes the underlying cognitive principles that support COOL:  
intentionality, evaluation, regeneration, narrative-binding,  
and identity continuity.
