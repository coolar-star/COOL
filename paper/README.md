## 📄 Paper

The full paper (PDF) is available here:

- `paper/Beyond_Memory_Stores.pdf`

This work proposes a **regenerative identity architecture** for large language models,
arguing that identity should be treated not as a memory store,
but as a *continuous regeneration process*.

The architecture is composed of:

- **COOL (Character Optimization Option Layer)**  
  A real-time character and identity constraint layer.
- **MOOL (Memory Optimization Option Layer)**  
  An offline, non-recorded, residue-based regeneration layer.

Together, they form a **Digital Hippocampus** for LLMs.

## 🧠 Core Idea

Current approaches to long-term behavior consistency in LLMs rely heavily on:
- Long-context prompting
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Persistent memory or logs

These approaches introduce:
- Identity drift
- Escalating storage and compute costs
- Fragile session-bound consistency

This paper reframes identity as:
> **Regeneration, not storage**

Identity is maintained through controlled reconstruction,
not through replaying stored information.
